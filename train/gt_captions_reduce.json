The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures.  Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall cease; I shall possess, within the veil, A life of joy and peace.

the naked light of day  And only now I see how the years ran away    Yesterday, When I Was Young  So many happy songs were waiting to be sung  So many way-ward pleasures lay in store for me  And so

itself with me, and nothing else at all    Yesterday the moon was blue  And every crazy day brought something new to do  I used my magic age as if it were a and  And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond    The game of love I played  With arrogance and pride and  every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died  The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away  And only I left on stage to end the

you bury it Just like you always did And now you're in all of my words only way I can return Memories fade in reverse but you will always be heard Wherever I can sing you'll be right there with me The
